# Introduction
This project provides a single function that enables you to stack code into the window onload event so that various functions can all be executed in order.

Usage examples to show two dialog messages in turn...
```
var stackManager = require("onload-function-stack");

var myFunc = function(msg) {
    alert(msg);
}

stackManager.add(myFunc, "Hello");
stackManager.add(myFunc, "Hello Again");
```
or if used as a straight reference...
```
var myFunc = function(msg) {
    alert(msg);
}

window.OnLoadStack.add(myFunc, "Hello");
window.OnLoadStack.add(myFunc, "Hello Again");
```
